#  CS 100 Virtual Teaching Assistant :
### What is it?
This project aims to cultivate algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills among beginners to coding. With the prevalence of tools like Chat-GPT, there's a tendency for learners to rely on copying and pasting coding solutions without fully engaging in the mental processes essential for becoming proficient coders. Our project seeks to bridge this gap by providing a chatbot as a teaching assistant that encourages active problem-solving and fosters a mindset geared towards algorithmic thinking.

### Our Dataset
We have curated a dataset of coding exercises, which serves as the foundation for our project. Our dataset for finetuning attempts can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1czTl1hxHkFfG6WsNWMGKEt0sZ7DftyNATBS0fS_JyCY/edit?usp=sharing). These sets are sourced from reputable platforms like [W3Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/cpp-exercises/#google_vignette), covering a range of topics in programming languages like C++.

### Paper Reference
To guide our project and methodologies, we are replicating the paper titled "[CodeAid](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11314.pdf)" This paper provides valuable insights and frameworks for developing effective educational tools to promote algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Our Success and Efforts
